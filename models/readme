Project Structure: Organize your project structure in a clear and logical manner, separating concerns like routes, 
controllers, models, and middleware into different directories.

Routing: Define your API routes using Express Router. Group related endpoints together and keep your routes organized.

Middleware: Use middleware functions for common tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, etc. Middleware can be 
applied globally or to specific routes as needed.

Error Handling: Implement error handling middleware to catch and handle errors gracefully. Return appropriate error responses to clients.

Validation: Validate incoming request data to ensure it meets expected formats and constraints. Use libraries like express-validator for input validation.
